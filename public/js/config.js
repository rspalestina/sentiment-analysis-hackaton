var SAMPLE_TEXT2 = 'It may be a gadget, but it is the best gadget I have ever owned. ZZZ has only missed a few words and that was because I wasn\'t speaking clearly. I love that it plays the music and playlists I have uploaded to YYY. I have used and love the shopping list feature, which works great with the cell phone app. It is a handy and time saving feature. The remote control is terrific. There is a multitude of things you can do with the XXX that will make your life more protective and enjoyable. Be creative and take the time to explore all the possibilities and I think this device will be amazing to you as well.\n'+
'I love this device.  It has been a lifesaver following my husbands\' surgery by being able to set multiple timers, playing music, answering questions, etc.  I gave this to my husband for his birthday and he didn\'t think he would like it.  After using it for a day, he is hooked and ZZZ is now a member of our household.\n'+
'I was an early adopter getting in on the $99.00 price. I am very impressed with how responsive the YYY XXX team is with our requests and feedback. I also created the community on Google plus called \'How to use the YYY XXX\' for people like me that own one or wanting one. I know it is developing and I am fine with that as along as they keep improving it. The speaker is fine for moderate listening levels and great for books on tape or the news.\n'+
'This device was a fun way to connect my Pandora and other music choices together as well as get on the spot news/weather reports. But it stopped functioning 2 weeks over the warranty and YYY said too bad so sad. Oh well I will not be buying another.\n'+
'XXX is a decent bluetooth speaker.   But for 199, you could find a better bluetooth speaker.   The voice recognition is fair to poor.   And the most frustrating part is that it can\'t play much of the YYY content - no Audible, no Kindle, and it can\'t recognize much of the YYY Prime library (other than the same 50 songs over and over  So, you are left with using it as a bluetooth speaker paired to your phone/tablet.\n'+
'ZZZ is a fascinating idea, but unfortunately YYY released it to the public without fully checking out its capabilities!  Tried to download all my ITunes ( at $25. bucks per year) and only half of my songs downloaded!  Called YYY and they offered to give me a $30 credit to buy the songs that didn\'t appear, but I am missing over 300 songs!!!! I told them to forget it and just cancel my subscription.  Much to YYY\'s credit, they told me they will try to solve this problem for me!  It\'s got to get better and you will love it!  Meanwhile, you have to deal with this product taking baby steps...hopefully it will be walking soon!\n'+
'I got it in January, I would return it if I could. Unpredictable results, one day works like a charm, the next day it won\'t connect to the cloud. Given the chance, I would look for other alternatives.\n'+
'I might as well use my laptop or phone\'s voice recognition to get information.  The reason I bought this was mostly to get quick answers to questions I had.  I\'m totally disappointed with it\'s ability to give answers to simple questions.  I asked \'When are the Tony Awards\' and several times it came up with an answer like, \'sorry, I do not know the answer to your question.  I had my wife ask the same question with the same response\'.\n'+
'Was excited to get my XXX today.  For the most part it worked well with realistic expectations.  Was extremely disappointed that there are no parental controls on this thing since it is advertised as a family product.  Imagine the surprise of parents everywhere where the voice recognition (which is not expected to be perfect) misunderstands a child\'s request, says the song has explicit lyrics, then belts out a harmonious string of obscenities to their six year child.  The advertisements on YYY\'s site shows a child using it with her parents, so why the huge oversight?  Think about all the song parodies out there - even if the voice recognition was perfect, the chances of it blasting out something explicit is pretty good.  In my opinion, the size of YYY\'s bank account was more important to them than providing a quality, well thought out product.  Both the Prime Music and XXX teams need to take a stroll down the hall and learn something from their Prime Video team mates.  Called YYY customer support about this and they suggested to press the button that disables the microphone - what\'s the point of owning one then????  Just like Prime Music, I don\'t see how anyone could recommend this product for any household with children - unless the parents in the household don\'t care what is listened to.\n'+
'The voice recognition is disappointing. I use another program for voice to text applications which works 10 times better than XXX at voice recognition right out of the box without training. As far as information XXX seems to be dumber than a box of hammers. The most often heard refrain is, \'I\'m sorry, I don\'t have the answer to that question.\' for even the simplest of questions like how tall is the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Missouri. It also often tells you to go to the XXX app and click on the Bing search link and enter your question there. That is why I have the XXX. So I don\'t need to stop and type stuff into a computer. It is also not very current. I live in the State of Quintana Roo in Mexico and we changed time to EST on Feb. 1st and ZZZ is still quoting CST when asked the time. I am not impressed that the unit has to remain plugged in all the time. Rechargeable batteries would make it so much more convenient but I am sure there is a price and size consideration involved there. On the other hand the music function is fabulous. The speaker system is superb for such a small small unit and I love being able to change volume and artists with a simple voice command. The microphone sensitivity is amazing. All in all the unit is worth the discounted price of $99 just for the music function alone but the other features have a long way to go. In case you are wondering I am a native English speaker born and raised in the United States so the voice recognition problem is not because of accent.';

'Omg! This is my new favorite place in alphabet city. Went here last night with one of my friends and was worried about it because I wanted to make sure they had some healthy stuff on the menu. Turns out I had NOTHING to be worried about, because 75% of the menu is healthy and delicious! I ordered the salmon with broccoli and greenbeans. Great portions :) the service was awesome too, as our waiter was very kind and gave great recommendations. Will be back again!\n' +
'I wish i could give Westville East a better rating because I really liked my experience at the west village location, but doing so would be dishonest. with more space and a more accessible location (for me at least), i wanted to love westville east, but instead, my experience led me to question whether or not i ever really loved either location in the first place.\n' +
'Oh Westville East, I love you and hate you so much...There\'s a lot to love about Westville; lots of healthy and tasty food options, market sides (I love that you can make a bunch of sides into a meal), well balanced menu, cute restaurant interior, delivery is fast half of the time. There\'s also a lot to hate; you will always have to wait to sit at the restaurant, the restaurant is extremely cramped, delivery takes forever half of the time, the food is pricey. Although I really don\'t love everything about this place, I am addicted to their beets, artichokes, Brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes and plantains. I can\'t stop wanting these items and no one else does it as good, or will serve this all to me on the same plate... So I guess I\'m just going to keep coming back FOREVER.\n';
